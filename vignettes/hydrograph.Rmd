# Building a Hydrograph with flowsep

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(flowsep)
```

## Steps

1.  Access USGS streamgage data for desired site (getUSGS)

    ```{r}
    gage_no <- "09315000"
    start_date <- "2021-09-30"
    end_date <- "2022-10-01"
    streamgage <- getUSGS(gage_no, start_date, end_date)
    head(streamgage)
    ```

2.  Conduct base-flow separation using the Lyne-Hollick recursive digital filter (filterLH)

    ```{r}
    filtered <- filterLH(streamgage)
    head(filtered)
    ```

3.  Plot the hydrograph with total flow and base flow (hydrograph)

    ```{r}
    hydrograph(filtered)
    ```
